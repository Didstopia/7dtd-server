This image will always install/update to the latest steamcmd and 7 Days to Die server, all you have to do to update your server is to redeploy the container.

Also note that the entire /steamcmd/7dtd can be mounted on the host system, which would avoid having to reinstall the game when updating or recreating the container.

### How to run the server
1. Optionally set the ```SEVEN_DAYS_TO_DIE_SERVER_STARTUP_ARGUMENTS``` environment variable to match your preferred server arguments (defaults are set to ```"-logfile /dev/stdout -quit -batchmode -nographics -dedicated"```, note how we're logging to stdout)
2. Optionally set the ```SEVEN_DAYS_TO_DIE_CONFIG_FILE``` environment variable to a different configuration file (default is ```/app/.local/share/7DaysToDie/serverconfig.xml```)
3. Mount ```/steamcmd/7dtd``` and ```/app/.local/share/7DaysToDie``` somewhere on the host to keep your data safe (first path has the server files, while the second path has the config and save files)
4. Run the server once to generate the default configuration file, then optionally edit it at ```/app/.local/share/7DaysToDie/serverconfig.xml``` to your liking

You can control the startup mode by using ```SEVEN_DAYS_TO_DIE_START_MODE```. This determines if the server should update and then start (mode 0), only update (mode 1) or only start (mode 2)) The default value is ```"0"```.

Note that you should also enable telnet and optionally modify the ```SEVEN_DAYS_TO_DIE_TELNET_PORT``` and ```SEVEN_DAYS_TO_DIE_TELNET_PASSWORD``` environment variables accordingly, so the container can properly send the shutdown command to the server when the proper signal has been received (it uses telnet for this).

One additional feature you can enable is fully automatic updates, meaning that once a server update hits Steam, it'll restart the server and trigger the automatic update. You can enable this by setting ```SEVEN_DAYS_TO_DIE_UPDATE_CHECKING``` to ```"1"```.  
You can also use a different branch via environment variables. For example, to install the latest experimental version, you would simply set ```SEVEN_DAYS_TO_DIE_BRANCH``` to ```latest_experimental``` (this is set to ```public``` by default).

If using Docker for Windows *and* the File System passthrough option, make sure to add the git repo drive letter as a shared drive through the Docker GUI.

### NOTES:

- telnet password seems to fail if other than alphanumeric (a-A, z-Z, 0-9)
- Run *docker-compose config* to check if you properly set things up in docker-compose file
